Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3


public class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count += n & 1; 
            n >>>= 1;      
        }
        return count;
    }
}
