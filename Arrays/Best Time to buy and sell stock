Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int min =Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      
        int max=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i]<min)
            min =prices[i];
            
            if(prices[i]-min >max)
            max =prices[i]-min;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
